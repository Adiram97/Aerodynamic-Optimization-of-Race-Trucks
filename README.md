# Aerodynamic-Optimization-of-Race-Trucks

This work is part of a course 'Aerodynamics of Transport Vehicles' during the Masters Curriculum. The objective of this project is to study the racing trucks and optimize a very simple truck referred as 'conventional model' (made up purely by 2 cuboids) such that it is aerodynamically efficient and would be fit for racing. Before the optimization, 2 trucks were studied: A real time racing truck, A futuristic model (Tesla Semi). The findings from the analysis of these two trucks were then implemented into the conventional model and this modified version is called 'Conventional modified'. Thus, the aerodynamic properties of the four trucks were considered, analysed and discussed. Furthermore, lap-time simulations were done in a circuit to understand the improved performance of the conventional modified model due to the rounded edges implemented. The results of the simulations confirms how the rounding the edges and plane roofs can help and improves the aerodynamic efficiency.
